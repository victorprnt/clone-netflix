# Netflix main page clone

## Objective
This project was proposed during Digital Innovation One Bootcamp. Its main purpose is to learn some front-end techniques as well as some other tricks.

We used the Owl Carousel to simulate the own Netflix movie carousel. This project constitutes only front-end learning, so there isn't any back-end programming.

We reinforced CSS and HTML skills. We used jQuery to import the carousel and learned how to use awesome fonts.

We also learned how to use media queries to work with responsiveness for different screen sizes.
